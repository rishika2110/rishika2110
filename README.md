### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), an AI and Robotics community.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning, mainly Natural Language Processing and Autoencoders.
- ðŸ‘¯ I would be glad to collaborate over any project that keeps my learning wheel spinning.
- ðŸ˜„ I aspire to make DL and NLP research more accessible and open-sourced.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to send virtual pigeons with letters about DL, Mathematics, dogs and alpacas.
- ðŸ“« Send your pigeons to bhagwatkarrishika@gmail.com.
- ðŸ¤” I often read literature and try to comprehend the thought process of the writer.
- âš¡ Oh, there's actually a paper on ["How to Read a Paper"](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf).
