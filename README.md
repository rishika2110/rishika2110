### Hello there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working at IvLabs, an AI and Robotics community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning, mainly Natural Language Processing and Autoencoders.
- 👯 I would be glad to collaborate over any project that keeps my learning wheel spinning.
- 😄 I aspire to make DL and NLP research more accessible and open-sourced.
- 💬 Feel free to send virtual pigeons with letters about DL, Mathematics, dogs and alpacas.
- 📫 Send your pigeons to bhagwatkarrishika@gmail.com.
- 🤔 I often read literature and try to comprehend the thought process of the writer.
- ⚡ Oh, there's actually a paper on ["How to Read a Paper"](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf).
