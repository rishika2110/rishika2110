### Hello there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at IvLabs, an AI and Robotics community.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning, mainly Natural Language Processing and Autoencoders.
- ğŸ‘¯ I would be glad to collaborate over any project that keeps my learning wheel spinning.
- ğŸ˜„ I aspire to make DL and NLP research more accessible and open sourced.
- ğŸ’¬ Feel free to send virtual pigeons with letters about DL, Mathematics, dogs and alpacas.
- ğŸ“« Send your pigeons to bhagwatkarrishika@gmail.com.
- ğŸ¤” I often read literature and try to comprehend the thought process of the writer.
- âš¡ Oh, There's actually paper on ["How to Read a Paper"](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf).
